Project: Figma-to-Website Build

Design Source:
This website is based on my own Figma design (homepage layout). The page includes a header, a hero image with a button, a row of cards, and a footer.

JavaScript Interactions:
1. Hero button alert popup.
2. Navigation button hover color change.
3. Scroll-trigger fade-in animation for the cards.

Challenges:
- Positioning the hero button centered over the image.
- Matching the Figma spacing with CSS Flexbox.
- Structuring semantic HTML based on the visual layout.

Files Included:
index.html
style.css
script.js
images/
README.txt
