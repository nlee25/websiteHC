figma to css html index proj

Design Source:
This website is based on my old  Figma design (homepage layout). The page includes a header, a character image with a button, a row of cards, and a footer.

JavaScript Interactions:
1. character banner button alert popup.
2. Nav button hover color change.
3. Scroll-trigger fade-in animation for the cards.

Challenges:
- Positioning the hero button centered over the image.
- Matching the Figma spacing with CSS Flexbox.
- Structuring semantic HTML based on the visual layout.

Files Included:
index.html
style.css
script.js

README.txt
